# Contributing to facebook-cli

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

This project is an attempt to implement a command line interface to Facebook using the [Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/).  Due to the severity of the [deprecations](README.md#why-cant-i) made by Facebook to this API in 2014 and 2015, full functionality cannot be achieved.  Perhaps a different project can explore what other features can be attained by another technique, such as using a headless browser.

Some of the ways you can help improve this utility:

- Report bugs

  If you've found a bug, please check the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/specious/facebook-cli/issues) to see if it has already been reported.  If not, feel free to open an issue.  Here's an article by [Josh Korr](https://twitter.com/joshkorr) about [how to write excellent bug reports](https://www.viget.com/articles/tips-for-writing-better-bug-reports).

- Add a feature

  It is very likely you desire some feature that is no longer achievable using the Graph API.  If you find a way to extend the functionality, by all means open a [pull request](https://github.com/specious/facebook-cli/pulls).

- Improve an existing feature

  Nothing is perfect, and often the best approach is open to interpretation.  If you think there's a better way to implement a feature, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/specious/facebook-cli/issues).

- Improve documentation

  Any way to make the documentation more clear is appreciated.

- Write tests

  Automated tests and continuous integration would be wonderful.
