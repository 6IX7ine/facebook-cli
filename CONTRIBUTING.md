# Contributing to facebook-cli

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

*facebook-cli* is an attempt to create a command line interface to the Facebook service mainly based on using the Graph API.  Due to the limited functionality remaining after the [deprecations](README.md#why-cant-i) made by Facebook in 2014 and 2015, there is only so much that can be done through *facebook-cli*.  Perhaps a different project can be started to see what other functionality can be achieved by another technique.

The following are some of the ways to help with improving *facebook-cli*:

- Reporting bugs

  If you've found a bug, please check the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/specious/facebook-cli/issues) to see if it has already been reported.  If not, feel free to open an issue.  Here's an article by [Josh Korr](https://twitter.com/joshkorr) about [how to write excellent bug reports](https://www.viget.com/articles/tips-for-writing-better-bug-reports).

- Adding a feature

  It is very likely you desire some feature that is no longer possible to achieve using the Graph API.  If, however, you find a way to implement a new piece of functionality, by all means do open a [pull request](https://github.com/specious/facebook-cli/pulls).

- Improving an existing feature

  Nothing is perfect, and often the best approach is open to interpretation.  If you think there's a better way to implement a feature, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/specious/facebook-cli/issues).
